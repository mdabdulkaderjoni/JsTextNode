        <h2> Array in Javascript </h2>

An array is a variable that can store multiple values. For example, if you want to store 100 integers, you can create an array for it.

let marks=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

<h3>How to declare an array?</h3>

variableKeyword variableName = [];

let marks=[]



<h3>Access Array Elements</h3>

You can access elements of an array by indices.

Suppose you declared an array mark as above. The first element is mark[0], the second element is mark[1] and so on.


<b>Few keynotes:</b>Arrays have 0 as the first index, not 1.

<h3>How to initialize an array?</h3>

let marks = [];
marks[0] = 1,
marks[1] = 2,
marks[2] = 3,
marks[3] = 4,
marks[5] = 5;

or you can just write

let mark = [19, 10, 8, 17, 9];


We can store multiple types of values in an array

let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 'Hello World', true, {name: 'Jhon', age: 12}]

<h2>Operations That Can Be Performed On Arrays</h2>

    <h3>1. Traversal</h3>
Traversing the array element means accessing each and every element of the array for a specific purpose.
Array is a linear data structure because all its elements forms a sequence, traversing its elements is very simple and 
straightforward.

<b>Algorithom for array traversal</b>

Step 1: [Initialization] Set I=lower_bound
Step 2: Repeat steps 3 to 4 while I<=upper_bound
Step 3: Apply process to A[I]
Step 4: Set I=I+1
	[End of Loop]
Step 5: Exit

<h3>Write a program to read and display n numbers using array</h>

let arr=[];
let i,num;

for(i=0;i<10;i++){
  num=parseInt(prompt(`Enter arr[${i}] = `));
  arr[i]=num;
}

for(i=0;i<10;i++){
  console.log(arr[i]);
}

Demo: arr=[33, 55, 88] 

group 0-10: 0
group 10-20: 0
group 20-30: 1

    <h3>2. Insertion</h3>

<b>Algorithom to insert a value in the array in a given position</b>

Step 1: [Initialization] Set I=N
Step 2: Repeat steps 3 and 4 while I>=Pos
Step 3: Set A[I+1]=A[I]
Step 4: Set I = I-1
        [End of Loop]
Step 5: Set N=N+1
Step 6: Set A[Pos]=Value
Step 7: Exit

    <h3>3. Deletion</h3>

<b>Algorithom to delete a value in the array in a given position</b>

Step 1: [Initialization] Set I=Pos
Step 2: Repeat steps 3 and 4 while I<=N-1
Step 3: Set A[I]=A[I+1]
Step 4: Set I = I-1
        [End of Loop]
Step 5: Set N=N-1
Step 6: Exit

    <h3>4. Merging</h3>

<h3>Multidimensional arrays (array of an array)</h3>

you can create an array of arrays. These arrays are known as multidimensional arrays. For example,

<h3>Initialization of a 2D array</h3>

let test = [ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] ]

<h3>Initialization of a 3D array</h3>

You can initialize a three-dimensional array in a similar way like a two-dimensional array. Here's an example,

let test = [
        [
            [3, 4, 2, 3], [0, -3, 9, 11], [23, 12, 23, 2]
        ],
        [   
            [13, 4, 56, 3], [5, 9, 3, 5], [3, 1, 4, 9]
        ]
    ];
