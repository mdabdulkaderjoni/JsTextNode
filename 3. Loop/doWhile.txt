C â€“ do..while loop
Syntax of do-while loop

do
{
    //Statements 

}while(condition test);
Flow diagram of do while loop
C do while loop

Example of do while loop
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int j=0;
	do
	{
		printf("Value of variable j is: %d\n", j);
		j++;
	}while (j<=3);
	return 0;
}
Output:


Value of variable j is: 0
Value of variable j is: 1
Value of variable j is: 2
Value of variable j is: 3
While vs do..while loop in C
Using while loop:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i=0;
    while(i==1)
    {
	printf("while vs do-while");
    }
    printf("Out of loop");
}
Output:

Out of loop
Same example using do-while loop

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   int i=0;
   do
   {
	printf("while vs do-while\n");
   }while(i==1);
   printf("Out of loop");
}
Output:

while vs do-while
Out of loop
Explanation: As I mentioned in the beginning of this guide that do-while runs at least once even if the condition is false because the condition is evaluated, after the execution of the body of loop.
