<h2>break statement</h2>

The break is a keyword  is used to bring the program control out of the loop. The break statement is used inside loops or 
switch statement. The break statement breaks the loop one by one, i.e., in the case of nested loops, it breaks the inner loop first 
and then proceeds to outer loops.

The break statement can be used in the following two scenarios:

<h3>With switch case</h3>
 
    let i=1;

    switch(i)
    {
    case 1:    
        printf("A"); 
        break;
       
    case 2:
        printf("B"); 
        break;
       
    case 3:
        printf("C");
        break;
    }

Output: A;


<h3>With loop</h3>
    
    let i;
    for(i = 0; i&lt;10; i++){  
        console.log(i) 
        if(i == 5){
            console.log('out of loop')
            break;
        } 
    }  
    console.log("came outside of loop i: ",i);  
 
Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 came outside of loop i = 5


<h3>break statement with the nested loop</h3>

In such case, it breaks only the inner loop, but not outer loop.


    let i=1,j=1;  
    for(i=1;i&lt;=3;i++){  

        for(j=1;&lt;<=3;j++){    
            console.log(`i is: ${i} and j is: ${j}`);    

            if(i==2 && j==2){    
                break; //will break loop of j only    
            }  

        }//end of for loop    
        
Output

1 1
1 2
1 3
2 1
2 2
3 1
3 2
3 3


As you can see the output on the console, 2 3 is not printed because there is a break statement after printing i==2 and j==2. 
But 3 1, 3 2 and 3 3 are printed because the break statement is used to break the inner loop only.

break statement with while loop
Consider the following example to use break statement inside while loop.

    let i = 0;  
    while(true){  
        console.log('i is: ',i)
        i++;  
        if(i == 10)  
        break;   
    }  
    console.log("came out of while loop");  

 
Output

0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  came out of while loop	

<h3>break statement with do-while loop</h3>
Consider the following example to use the break statement with a do-while loop.

   let n=2,i,choice;  
   do
   {  
       i=1;  
       while(i&lt;=10)  
       {  
           console.log(`${n} * ${i} = ${n*i}`) 
           i++;  
       }  
       console.log(`do you want to continue with the table of ${n+1}?  enter any non-zero value to continue`)  

       choice=Number(prompt('Enter a value: ')) 

       if(choice == 0){  
           break;  
       }  
       n++;  
   }while(true);  



  
Output

2 X 1 = 2
2 X 2 = 4
2 X 3 = 6
2 X 4 = 8
2 X 5 = 10
2 X 6 = 12
2 X 7 = 14
2 X 8 = 16
2 X 9 = 18
2 X 10 = 20

do you want to continue with the table of 3 , enter any non-zero value to continue. pressed: 1



3 X 1 = 3
3 X 2 = 6
3 X 3 = 9
3 X 4 = 12
3 X 5 = 15
3 X 6 = 18
3 X 7 = 21
3 X 8 = 24
3 X 9 = 27
3 X 10 = 30

do you want to continue with the table of 4 , enter any non-zero value to continue. pressed: 0
