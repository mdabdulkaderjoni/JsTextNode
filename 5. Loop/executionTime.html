    <h2>How to measure execution time of a method in JavaScript</h2>

Measuring the execution times of a code snippet can be essential as a form of debugging, 
especially when some other component is time-dependent on that piece of code for its execution (e.g. animations).

    <h3>1. performance.now()</h3>
The performance.now() method returns the time elapsed since the time origin, measured in milliseconds. It returns timestamp up to 
microsecond precision. The following example demonstrates the usage of performance.now() method to track execution time of an operation


//const { JSDOM } = require("jsdom");
//const { window } = new JSDOM();
 
var start = window.performance.now();
 
// task starts
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100000000;i++);
// task ends
 
var end = window.performance.now();
console.log(`Execution time: ${end - start} ms`);
 
Alternatively, 
you can use the performance.now() method from Performance Timing API which is the same as implemented in modern Web browsers.


const {performance} = require('perf_hooks');
 
var start = performance.now();
 
// task starts
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100000000;i++);
// task ends
 
var end = performance.now();
console.log(`Execution time: ${end - start} ms`);
 

<h3>2. Console.time()</h3>

The console.timeEnd() method starts a timer with the specified label. Subsequent call to the console.timeEnd() method with same label 
will output milliseconds elapsed since the first call was made.

console.time('Execution Time');
 
// task starts
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100000000;i++);
// task ends
 
console.timeEnd('Execution Time');


let time = "";

//start
console.time('time');
//loop
for(let i=1; i&lt;= 1e6; i++)
    time+=i;
//end
console.timeEnd('time');


There is nothing new in this code — only the start time was replaced by console.time(“”) and the end time was replaced by 
console.timeEnd(), which indicates the end of the time calculation. It automatically console.log()s the timings and we don’t have to 
do any extra calculations. Handy as it is, it is only supported on modern browsers. These methods help us in a way but won’t get us 
too far, as they are not as precise as they claim to be. Granted, console.time is better than Date().getTime(), but it still does not 
make the cut. For high-precision timing calculations, there is a different API called the Performance interface, 
which again is implemented by mostly all of the modern browsers.
 

<h3>3. Date Object</h3>

Another plausible way to track how long an operation took is to use the Date.now() method which returns the number of milliseconds 
elapsed since the Unix Epoch. This is demonstrated below:


var start =  Date.now();
 
// task starts
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100000000;i++);
// task ends
 
var end =  Date.now();
console.log(`Execution time: ${end - start} ms`);
 
Alternatively, you can use the unary plus to convert the given date returned by Date constructor into milliseconds.


var start = +new Date();
 
// task starts
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100000000;i++);
// task ends
 
var end = +new Date();
console.log(`Execution time: ${end - start} ms`);

<h4>with getTime() method</h4>
let time = "";

//start
let start = new Date().getTime();
//Code whose execution time is to be measured
for(let i=1; i&lt;= 1e6; i++)
    time+=i;
//Finish

let end=new Date().getTime();
//The difference is the output
console.log(end-start);

The code above notes the starting time just before the start of the loop. The loop runs for 1 million (1e6==1000000) iterations and 
executes a simple addition task. After the loop, we record the time again, this time calling it the end time. The difference of the 
start and the end gives us the time elapsed while running the loop. I got the result as 165 on my machine. On your machine, 
it might be different. Though simple, it is frankly not very accurate. That’s why we have console.log(time).
