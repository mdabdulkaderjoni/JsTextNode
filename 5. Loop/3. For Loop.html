    <h2 style="color: green;">For loop</h2>

This is one of the most frequently used loop in programming.
Syntax of for loop:

<h3>
for (initialization; condition test; increment or decrement)
{
       //Statements to be executed repeatedly
}</h3>

Flow Diagram of For loop

Step 1: First initialization happens and the counter variable gets initialized.

Step 2: In the second step the condition is checked, where the counter variable is tested for the given condition, 
if the condition returns true then the C statements inside the body of for loop gets executed, 
if the condition returns false then the for loop gets terminated and the control comes out of the loop.

Step 3: After successful execution of statements inside the body of loop, the counter variable is incremented or decremented, 
depending on the operation (++ or –).

Example of For loop

   let i;
   for (i=1; i&lt;=3; i++)
   {
       console.log(i);
   }

Output:

1
2
3

<h2 style="color:green;">Various forms of for loop</h2>

I am using variable num as the counter in all the following examples –

1) Here instead of num++, I’m using num=num+1 which is same as num++.

for (num=10; num&lt;20; num=num+1)

2) Initialization part can be skipped from loop as shown below, the counter variable is declared before the loop.

let num=10;
for ( ; num&lt;20; num++)

Note: Even though we can skip initialization part but semicolon (;) before condition is must,
without which you will get compilation error.
3) Like initialization, you can also skip the increment part as we did below. In this case semicolon (;) is must after condition logic.
In this case the increment or decrement part is done inside the loop.

for (num=10; num&lt;20; )
{
      //Statements
      num++;
}


4) This is also possible. The counter variable is initialized before the loop and incremented inside the loop.

int num=10;
for ( ; num&lt;20; )
{
      //Statements
      num++;
}

5) As mentioned above, the counter variable can be decremented as well. In the below example 
the variable gets decremented each time the loop runs until the condition num>10 returns false.

for(num=20; num>10; num--)


<h2>Nested For Loop</h2>

Nesting of loop is also possible. Lets take an example to understand this:


   for (let i=0; i&lt;2; i++)
   {
	    for (let j=0; j&lt;4; j++)
	    {
	        console.log(i+', '+j);
	    }
   }

Output:

0, 0
0, 1
0, 2
0, 3
1, 0
1, 1
1, 2
1, 3

In the above example we have a for loop inside another for loop, this is called nesting of loops. 
<h4>One of the example where we use nested for loop is Two dimensional array.</h4>

<h2>Multiple initialization inside for Loop</h2>

We can have multiple initialization in the for loop as shown below.

for (i=1,j=1; i&lt;10 && j&lt;10;  i++, j++)

<h3>What’s the difference between above for loop and a simple for loop?</h3>

1. It is initializing two variables. Note: both are separated by comma (,).

2. It has two test conditions joined together using AND (&&) logical operator. 
<h4 style="color:red;">Note: You cannot use multiple test conditions separated by comma, you must use logical operator such as && or || to join conditions.</h4>

3. It has two variables in increment part. Note: Should be separated by comma.

Example of for loop with multiple test conditions

   let i,j;
   for (i=1,j=1 ; i&lt;3 || j&lt;5; i++,j++)
   {
	    console.log(i, j);
   }
