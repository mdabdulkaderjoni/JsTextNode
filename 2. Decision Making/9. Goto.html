                                <h2 align="center">C goto statement</h2>

The goto statement is known as jump statement in C. As the name suggests, goto is used to transfer the program control to a predefined
label. The goto statment can be used to repeat some part of the code for a particular condition. It can also be used to break the 
multiple loops which can't be done by using a single break statement. However, using goto is avoided these days since it makes the 
program less readable and complecated.

Syntax:

label:   
//some part of the code;   
goto label;

goto example

Let's see a simple example to use goto statement in C language.

#include &lt;stdio.h>  
int main()   
{  
  int num,i=1; 
  
  printf("Enter the number whose table you want to print?");   
  scanf("%d",&num); 
 
  table:   
  printf("%d x %d = %d\n",num,i,num*i);  
  i++;  

  if(i&lt;=10)  
  goto table;    
} 

 
Output:

Enter the number whose table you want to print?10

10 x 1 = 10
10 x 2 = 20
10 x 3 = 30
10 x 4 = 40
10 x 5 = 50
10 x 6 = 60
10 x 7 = 70
10 x 8 = 80
10 x 9 = 90
10 x 10 = 100
 
<h3>When should we use goto?</h3>

The only condition in which using goto is preferable is when we need to break the multiple loops using a single statement at the same time. 

Consider the following example.

#include &lt;stdio.h>  
int main()   
{  
  int i, j, k;    
  for(i=0;i&lt;10;i++)  
  {  
    for(j=0;j&lt;5;j++)  
    {  
      for(k=0;k&lt;3;k++)  
      {  
        printf("%d %d %d\n",i,j,k);  
        if(j == 3)  
        {  
          goto out;   
        }  
      }  
    }  
  }  
  out:   
  printf("came out of the loop");   
} 


Output:
 
0 0 0
0 0 1
0 0 2
0 1 0
0 1 1
0 1 2
0 2 0
0 2 1
0 2 2
0 3 0
came out of the loop
