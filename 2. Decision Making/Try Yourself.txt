1. Food order system menu bar and calculate prices

demo:

choose your food
1. Burger 180 tk
2. Pizza  250 tk
3. Shawrma 120 tk
4. Drinks 80 tk

pressed 2:

how many burgers?

pressed 2

Final ouput: Total is 500 tk


2. decorate notes of money 

demo:

Notes are in 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 
please enter an positive number as money between 1 to 1000

entered 740

Final output: 200*2+20*2

500*1+200*1+20*2;


3. Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:


If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
Input Format:
A single line containing a positive integer, n.
Constraints:
n lies between 1 and 100

Input:
17

Output:
Weird

4. you must solve this problem only using switch case // hints: try nested switch case

Find the largest number among there numbers

demo:

enter first number
user entered: 33
enter second number
user entered: 44
enter third number
user entered: 11

final output: 44 is largest

5. you can use if else where necessary but switch case is must
   and also must use charCodeAt() function
   there is a code given below, you can change add remove case and other codes
   but for loop will remain as it is


demo: 

enter a string of 5 letters

user entered Hello

final output: 2 vowels found and they are e and o



hints: 

let i,  str='Hello';
// console.log(str.charCodeAt(0)); // H = 72 at 0
// console.log(str.charCodeAt(1)); // e = 101 at 1
// console.log(str.charCodeAt(2)); // l = 108 at 2
// console.log(str.charCodeAt(3)); // l = 108 at 3
// console.log(str.charCodeAt(4)); // H = 111 at 4

for(i=0;i<str.length;i++){


  switch(str.charCodeAt(i)){
   
   
  }
}
