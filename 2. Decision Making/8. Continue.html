<h2>continue statement</h2>

The continue statement  is used to bring the program control to the beginning of the loop. The continue statement skips 
some lines of code inside the loop and continues with the next iteration. It is mainly used for a condition so that we can skip some 
code for a particular condition.

Syntax:

//loop statements  
continue;  

//some lines of the code which is to be skipped

Continue statement example 1

    let i=0;

    while(i!=10){  
        console.log('i is: ',i)  
        continue;   
        i++;  
    }  
 
Output: infinite loop


Continue statement example 2

    let i;
      
    //starting a loop from 1 to 10    
    for(i=1;i&lt;=10;i++){      
        if(i==5){   //if value of i is equal to 5, it will continue the loop    
            continue;    
        }
    
        console.log('i is: ',i)    
     }//end of for loop    
    
   
Output

1
2
3
4
6
7
8
9
10


As you can see, 5 is not printed on the console because loop is continued at i==5.

<h3>continue statement with inner loop</h3>

In such case, continue statement continues only inner loop, but not outer loop.
  
    let i=1,j=1;  
    for(i=1;i<=3;i++){      
        for(j=1;j<=3;j++){    
            if(i==2 && j==2){    
                continue;//will continue loop of j only    
            }    
            console.log('i is: '+i+' j is: '+j)  
        }  
  
     }//end of for loop 

   
Output

1 1
1 2
1 3
2 1
2 3
3 1
3 2
3 3

As you can see, 2 2 is not printed on the console because inner loop is continued at i==2 and j==2.
