When you want to solve multiple option type problems, for example: Menu like program, where one value is associated with each option and 
you need to choose only one at a time, then, switch statement is used.

Switch statement is a control statement that allows us to choose only one choice among the many given choices. The expression in switch 
evaluates to return an integral value, which is then compared to the values present in different cases. It executes that block of code 
which matches the case value. If there is no match, then default block is executed(if present). The general form of switch statement is,

switch(expression)
{
    case value-1:
    	block-1;
    	break;
    case value-2:
    	block-2;
    	break;
    case value-3:
    	block-3;
    	break;
    case value-4:
    	block-4;
   	    break;
    default:
   	    default-block;
    	break;
}

<h3>This is how it works:</h3>

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

<h3>Points to Remember:</h3>
break statements are used to exit the switch block. It isn't necessary to use break after each block, but if you do not use it, 
then all the consecutive blocks of code will get executed after the matching block.

let i = 1;
switch(i)
{
    case 1:    
        console.log("A");        // No break
    case 2:
        console.log("B");        // No break
    case 3:
        console.log("C");
        break;
}

output: A B C

The output was supposed to be only A because only the first case matches, but as there is no break statement after that block, 
the next blocks are executed too, until it a break statement in encountered or the execution reaches the end of the switch block.

default case is executed when none of the mentioned case matches the switch expression. 
The default case can be placed anywhere in the switch case. Even if we don't include the default case, switch statement works.

<h3>The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.</h3>

This example uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
    day = "Sunday";
    break;
  case 1:
    day = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
     day = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    day = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    day = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    day = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    day = "Saturday";
}
console.log(day)

Sometimes you will want different switch cases to use the same code.

In this example case 4 and 5 share the same code block, and 0 and 6 share another code block:

let text;
let n = new Date().getDay()
console.log(n)
switch (n) {
  case 4:
  case 5:
    text = "Soon it is Weekend";
    break;
  case 0:
  case 6:
    text = "It is Weekend";
    break;
  default:
    text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}
console.log(text)

We can do basic calculations and also take input inside case

Example of switch statement

         let a, b, c, choice;

          choice=Number(prompt('1. Press 1 for addition\n
                                2. Press 2 for subtraction'))
        
          switch(choice)
          {
              case 1:
                  a=Number(prompt('Enter a number'))
                  b=Number(prompt('Enter another number'))
                  c = a + b;
                  console.log('Sum is: '+c)
                  break;

              case 2:
                 a=Number(prompt('Enter a number'))
                 b=Number(prompt('Enter another number'))
                 c = a - b;
                 console.log('Sub is: '+c)
                 break;

              default:
                  console.log("you have passed a wrong key");
                 
          }


<h3>Nested switch case statement</h3>

Nesting of switch statements are allowed, which means you can have switch statements inside another switch block. 
However, nested switch statements should be avoided as it makes the program more complex and less readable.


We can use as many switch statement as we want inside a switch statement. Such type of statements is called nested switch case statements. 
Consider the following example. 
  
     const i = 10,  j = 20;  
   
     switch(i) 
     {  
     
        case 10:   
           console.log("the value of i evaluated in outer switch\n");  
           break;
        case 20: 
           switch(j) 
           {  
              case 20:  
                 console.log("The value of j evaluated in nested switch\n");  
           }  
           break;
       }  
     


<h3>Difference between switch and if</h3>

if statements can evaluate float conditions. switch statements cannot evaluate float conditions.
if statement can evaluate relational operators. switch statement cannot evaluate relational operators i.e 
they are not allowed in switch statement.

let text;
let n=5.5
console.log(n)
switch (n) {
 
  case 5:
    text = "Soon it is Weekend";
    break;

  case 6:
    text = "It is Weekend";
    break;
    
  default:
    text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}
console.log(text)

output: Looking forward to the Weekend

The expression provided in the switch should result in a constant value otherwise it would not be valid.
For example:

Valid expressions for switch –

switch(1+2+23)
switch(1*2+3%4)

Invalid switch expressions –

switch(ab+cd)
switch(a+b+c)
