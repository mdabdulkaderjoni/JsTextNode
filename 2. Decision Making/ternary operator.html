<h3> Conditional operator ‘?’</h3>

Sometimes, we need to assign a variable depending on a condition.

For instance:

let accessAllowed;
let age = prompt('How old are you?', '');

if (age > 18) {
  accessAllowed = true;
} else {
  accessAllowed = false;
}

alert(accessAllowed);


The so-called “conditional” or “question mark” operator lets us do that in a shorter and simpler way.

<mark>The operator is represented by a question mark ?. Sometimes it’s called “ternary”, because the operator has three operands.</mark>
It is actually the one and only operator in JavaScript which has that many.

The syntax is:

let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
The condition is evaluated: if it’s truthy then value1 is returned, otherwise – value2.

For example:

let accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;

Technically, we can omit the parentheses around age > 18. 
<mark>The question mark operator has a low precedence, so it executes after the comparison >.</mark>

This example will do the same thing as the previous one:

// the comparison operator "age > 18" executes first anyway
// (no need to wrap it into parentheses)

let accessAllowed = age > 18 ? true : false;

<mark>But parentheses make the code more readable, so we recommend using them.
</mark>
Please note:
In the example above, you can avoid using the question mark operator because the comparison itself returns true/false:

// the same
let accessAllowed = age > 18;
Multiple ‘?’
A sequence of question mark operators ? can return a value that depends on more than one condition.

For instance:

let age = prompt('age?', 18);

let message = (age &lt; 3) ? 'Hi, baby!' :
  (age &lt; 18) ? 'Hello!' :
  (age &lt; 100) ? 'Greetings!' :
  'What an unusual age!';

alert( message );

It may be difficult at first to grasp what’s going on. But after a closer look, we can see that it’s just an ordinary sequence of tests:

The first question mark checks whether age &lt; 3.
If true – it returns 'Hi, baby!'. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the colon ‘":"’, checking age &lt; 18.
If that’s true – it returns 'Hello!'. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the next colon ‘":"’, checking age &lt; 100.
If that’s true – it returns 'Greetings!'. Otherwise, it continues to the expression after the last colon ‘":"’, 
returning 'What an unusual age!'.

Here’s how this looks using if..else:

if (age &lt; 3) {
  message = 'Hi, baby!';
} else if (age &lt; 18) {
  message = 'Hello!';
} else if (age &lt; 100) {
  message = 'Greetings!';
} else {
  message = 'What an unusual age!';
}

<h3>Non-traditional use of ‘?’</h3>
Sometimes the question mark ? is used as a replacement for if:

let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');
(company == 'Netscape') ?
   alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');

Depending on the condition company == 'Netscape', either the first or the second expression after the ? gets executed and shows an alert.

<mark>We don’t assign a result to a variable here. Instead, we execute different code depending on the condition.</mark>

<p style="color: red;">It’s not recommended to use the question mark operator in this way.</p>

The notation is shorter than the equivalent if statement, which appeals to some programmers. But it is less readable.

Here is the same code using if for comparison:

let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');

if (company == 'Netscape') {
  alert('Right!');
} else {
  alert('Wrong.');
}
Our eyes scan the code vertically. Code blocks which span several lines are easier to understand than a long, horizontal instruction set.

The purpose of the question mark operator ? is to return one value or another depending on its condition. 
Please use it for exactly that. Use if when you need to execute different branches of code.

<h3>Nested ternary operators</h3>
You can also nest one ternary operator as an expression inside another ternary operator. For example,

// program to check if number is positive, negative or zero
let a = 3;
let result = (a >= 0) ? (a == 0 ? "zero" : "positive") : "negative";
console.log(`The number is ${result}.`);

Output: The number is positive.
 

<b>Note:</b> You should try to avoid nested ternary operators whenever possible as they make your code hard to read.

<h3>Predict the output of below programs</h3>
let x;
x = 5 > 8 ? 10 : 1 != 2 &lt; 5 ? 20 : 30;
console.log('X is: ',x)

let x;
x = 5 &lt; 8 ? 1 != 2 &lt; 5 == 0 ? 10 : 20 : 30;
console.log('X is: ',x)

let x;
x = 2 > 5 != 1 ? 5 &lt; 8 && 8 > 2 ? !5 ? 10 : 20 : 30 : 40;
console.log('X is: ',x)

let x;
x = 2 > 5 ? 1 != 2 > 5 ? 10 : 20 : 5 &lt; 8 ? 2 != 2 > 5 ?
    !5 ? 30 : !1 != 1 ? 40 : 50 : 60 : 70;

console.log('X is: ',x)

<h3>n this Program we have used the conditional operator for comparing biggest of three numbers.</h3>
let a=12, b=33, c=44, 
big, small ;

small=(a&lt;b? (a&lt;c?a:c) : (b&lt;c?b:c)
console.log('Small is: ',small);

big = a > b ? (a > c ? a : c) : (b > c ? b : c) ;
console.log('Big is: ',big)
