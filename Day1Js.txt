			JavaScript Operators

JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands. For example:

var sum=10+20;  


There are following types of operators in JavaScript.


Arithmetic Operators

+	Addition	10+20 = 30
-	Subtraction	20-10 = 10
*	Multiplication	10*20 = 200
/	Division	20/10 = 2
%	Modulus (Remainder)	20%10 = 0


Increment/Decrement Operators

++	Increment	var a=10; a++; Now a = 11
--	Decrement	var a=10; a--; Now a = 9

pre increment/decrement and post increment/decrement

pre - means first increment/decrement then assign it to another variable
post - means first assign it to another variable then increment/decrement



rvalue cannot be used before or after increment/decrement operator

eorror:x = ++(a+b) or x = (a+b)++
but this is correct: x=++x or x=x++;

lvalue and rvalue

lvalue - must be a variable.  var a = x+y here a is lvalue

rvalue - anything which is capable of returning a constant expression or value. var a = x+y here (x+y)  is rvalue


error: var a=10; a ++ a // because unary can't be performed on 2 operands

var a=3, b=4, c;
c=a+++b;
console.log(c,a);

c=a+ ++b;
console.log(c,b);

lexical analysis
phrase of compiler

x=-(a-b)

Interview Q:
1. when to use pre/post increment/decrement operators
2. what is lvalue and rvalue?
3. differences between unary and binay?
4. what do arithmetic operators do and what are they?
5. is ! binary or unary?
6. is using the + or unary plus operator the fastest way in converting a string to a number?

Comparison (Relational) Operators

==	Is equal to	10==20 = false
!=	Not equal to	10!=20 = true
>	Greater than	20>10 = true
>=	Greater than or equal to	20>=10 = true
<	Less than	20<10 = false
<=	Less than or equal to	20<=10 = false

Javascript:

===	Identical (equal and of same type)	10==20 = false
!==	Not Identical	20!==20 = false

Interview Q:

1. difference between == and === equal operator in javascript


Bitwise Operators

&	Bitwise AND	(10==20 & 20==33) = false
|	Bitwise OR (inclusive)	(10==20 | 20==33) = false
^	Bitwise XOR (exclusive)	(10==20 ^ 20==33) = false
~	Bitwise NOT	(~10) = -10
<<	Bitwise Left Shift	(10<<2) = 40
>>	Bitwise Right Shift	(10>>2) = 2

AND &
0 & 0 = 0
0 & 1 = 0
1 & 1 = 1

OR |
0 | 0 = 0
0 | 1 = 1
1 | 1 = 1

XOR ^
0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0

Left Shift <<
3 << 1 = 6  which is 3 * (2 to the power 1)
3 << 2 = 12 which is 3 * (2 to the power 2)
3 << 3 = 24 which is 3 * (2 to the power 3)

Right Shift >>
24 >> 1 = 12 which is 3 / (2 to the power 1)
24 >> 2 = 6  which is 3 / (2 to the power 2)
24 >> 3 = 3  which is 3 / (2 to the power 3)


Javascript:

>>>	Bitwise Right Shift with Zero	(10>>>2) = 2


Logical Operators

&&	Logical AND	(10==20 && 20==33) = false
||	Logical OR	(10==20 || 20==33) = false
!	Logical Not	!(10==20) = true



Javascript:

?? Nullish coalescing operator
?. Optional chaining

Interview Q:
1. What does the && operator do?
2. what does the || operator do?
3. what does the !! operator do?
4. which operator checks if the value is null?
5. which opearator is called the optional chaning operator?

Assignment Operators

=	Assign	10+10 = 20
+=	Add and assign	var a=10; a+=20; Now a = 30
-=	Subtract and assign	var a=20; a-=10; Now a = 10
*=	Multiply and assign	var a=10; a*=20; Now a = 200
/=	Divide and assign	var a=10; a/=2; Now a = 5
%=	Modulus and assign	var a=10; a%=2; Now a = 0
<<=
>>=
&=
|=
^=

Javascript:

>>>=
**= Exponentiation assignment 
??= Logical nullish assignment 


Special Operators

(?:)	Conditional Operator returns value based on the condition. It is like if-else.
,	Comma Operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated as single statement.
instanceof	checks if the object is an instance of given type
new	creates an instance (object)
typeof	checks the type of object.
void	it discards the expression's return value.

Interview Q:
1. what is the meaning of void?
2. use and live example of instanceof operator

Javascript:

delete	Delete Operator deletes a property from the object.
in	In Operator checks if object has the given property
yield	checks what is returned in a generator by the generator's iterator.


binary operators and unary operators?

operator precedence

* / % same 

+ - is left to right

Interview Q:
1. describe operators precedences?


Escape Sequences

Single character escape sequences
There are some reserved single character escape sequences for use in strings:

\b: backspace (U+0008 BACKSPACE)
\f: form feed (U+000C FORM FEED)
\n: line feed (U+000A LINE FEED)
\r: carriage return (U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN) //In most cases, browsers ignore carriage returns or render them like spaces
\t: horizontal tab (U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION)
\v: vertical tab (U+000B LINE TABULATION)
\0: null character (U+0000 NULL) (only if the next character is not a decimal digit; else itâ€™s an octal escape sequence)
\': single quote (U+0027 APOSTROPHE)
\": double quote (U+0022 QUOTATION MARK)
\\: backslash (U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS)
